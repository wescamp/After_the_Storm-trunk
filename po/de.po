"weapon: the biomechanicals, known in their ancient tongue as 'Shaxthals'. "
"These invincible legionnaries combined the toughest and most lethal "
"attributes of every creature known by their creators. They served as "
"protectors to the Argazars, but could not guard them against RythÃ©nian "
"strategic weapons. The RythÃ© desolated the lands of Irdya, destroyed the "
"cities, and buried the works of the Argazars.\n"
"\n"
"A remnant of the Argazars, buried deep in the very underground base where "
"shaxthal production was centered. The RythÃ©nians thought their race was "
"gone, so they ceased attacking the planet. No one knows what events took "
"place on the surface during centuries and millennia that followed, as the "
"shattered ecology of Irdya reknit itself. But what is known, is that the "
"Argazars lost control over their creations -- or, rather, their creations "
"ceased recognizing them as masters. Whether this was due to a mutation in "
"the shaxthal or the remnant Argazars themselves is not known.\n"
"\n"
"Without the direction of the Argazars, the instincts of the shaxthals "
"prevailed. Their drives were a strange and predatory mixture of those of "
"their biological ancestors and the warfare programming of their artificial "
"bodies. Those instincts eventually drove them them to consume the remainins "
"of the Argazar civilization. Eventually they took the Argazars' bodies and "
"integrated them into their own buiomechanical plan. For they had been "
"designed with an assimilation system that allowed them to integrate into new "
"environments, or adapt the environments themselves to suit their needs, "
"including any living organisms that might inhabit them.\n"
"\n"
"The Shaxthals kept most of the technology of the Argazars, losing magic and "
"the advanced forms of biomanipulation with which they had been created. "
"Reduced to barely a few dozen, the Argazars figured out a biological "
"weakness of their creations, a way to destroy most of the Shaxthals en "
"masse. All but a few of the strongest shaxthals perished. Fatefully, the "
"Argazars decided to keep them in cryogenic pods instead of destroying them "
"forever, as they thought there might be a last hope of using reprogrammed "
"shaxthals to rebuild their civilization at some point in the future. That "
"foolish thought was almost condemned the Great Continent to an armageddon "
"millennia later.\n"
"\n"
"Long after the Fall of Wesnoth, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Chaos figured "
"out a way to resurrect the creatures, and reproduce their technology by "
"artificial means. The chaos mages of the Empire even enabled them to them "
"able to reproduce by natural, asexual means. Thus modified, they became the "
"principal and most dreaded weapon of the Chaos Empire. After the defeat of "
"Argan the Shadow Master, the Shaxthals were freed from their imprisonment in "
"the dark hives of the Heart, and adapted to the time-renewed ecology of the "
"surface world. They then began to prey on the speaking peoples of Irdya."
