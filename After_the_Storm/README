AFTER THE STORM (AtS)
---------------------

By Ignacio R. Morelle <shadowmaster/ShikadiLord>

This campaign is a direct sequel to Invasion from the Unknown (IftU), and takes
place a few days after its epilogue. Whereas IftU is focused on the wanderings
and unpeaceful life of Galas, AtS centers its attention back to Elynia of the
Lintanir Forest.

NOTE: THIS CAMPAIGN IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, AND HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED TO THE
PUBLIC YET! The plan is to release it as soon as the story is well defined and
enough scenarios are completed. Support for Wesnoth 1.6 will probably be never
provided.

Compared to IftU, the story line of this campaign is supposed to be have a much
darker tone, although the gameplay should be relatively easier. It also serves
as a joint point between Under the Burning Suns (UtBS) and IftU. The history
converges in this campaign and most loose knots are finally solved.

It should also be much cleaner in design (WML) than IftU.
